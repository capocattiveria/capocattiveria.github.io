## Who Am I?

I am Nico Fiorini\
A student of computer Engineering, and this is the journey of my mind and work.

## Why a blog and not a social media?

The blog is a very free form of sharing. Compared to social media, a blog allows for a more comprehensive presentation of content, enabling the inclusion of almost anything. The only limit is time and creativity.

Lately, I discovered Elixir, and I think the functional programming can scary someone, but once you get in, is a good way to learn a different approach to programming, and Elixir is a modern language based on Erlang VM.

I want to share some resources that I found useful for become more comfortable with the language.

## Resources

1. **Official Documentation and guide**: <https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction.html>.
2. **Elixir School**: <https://elixirschool.com/en>

  I think that this website cover the principal aspect of the language, is simple and minimal for learning fast.

3. **A good book**: <https://elixir-lang.org/learning.html#books>

  This is the book tips from the official Elixir website, I read a little bit of *"Learn functional programming with Elixir"*
  Maybe for Elixir you can get most of how it works from *"Elixir in Action"*, cover some part of the concurrency in beam that helps to get how it works the concurrency.

1. **Exercise**: <https://exercism.org/>.

*Ecercism.org* require a registration, but is also useful also for other programming languages. The only drawback is that it often takes more time to understand what the exercise requires than actually coding it.

I believe that to truly grasp the language, you need to practice. *Exercism.org* is a good website, although it may take too much time to cover all aspects of Elixir. Perhaps it's better to exercise directly with a personal project

5. **Interoperability tutorial**:

Elixir is not well made for some aspect, like "Serious math" or "command line applications" and other things, so you need to integrate some other languages, and to learn how to do I found two resources: The book *"Adopting Elixir"* contains a chapter for this topic and the [Erlang interoperability tutorial](https://www.erlang.org/doc/tutorial/users_guide).

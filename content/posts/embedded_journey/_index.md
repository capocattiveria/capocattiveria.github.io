As stated in this blog, I want to share my journey, and in this section,
I will share problems and challenges in embedded systems that I will encounter from now on.
I firmly believe that sharing and explanation are fundamental for detailed and comprehensive learning.

Acquiring knowledge and skills requires constant commitment and prolonged practice over time.
It is essential to start from the basics to build a solid understanding and be able to successfully
tackle more complex projects and problems.
As I face challenges and solve problems along the way, I will share some of my experiences and solutions,
hoping to inspire and assist anyone interested in
delving into this fascinating world that is still relatively unexplored by me.

My repository for the code is in this link: [embedded journey repository](https://github.com/nicofiorini98/embedded_journey/tree/master)

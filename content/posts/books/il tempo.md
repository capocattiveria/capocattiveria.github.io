Once I tried to think about the nature of time, but obviously, I didn't come to a conclusion, and I don't think I even got close to understanding it. Intuitively, time seems to be a measure of how frequently events occur. Simply put, the ticking of the second hand is an event that happens regularly. Events that happen regularly allow us to have a more accurate perception of time, like the sunrise or the changing of seasons.

However, if I try to grasp what time is from a physical point of view, it's not straightforward. I can't truly imagine what time is; we have a perception of it because we can distinguish the past thanks to memory, but ultimately time remains something difficult to grasp. I can only have an intuition in terms of events, and since events happen differently in different points of space, it turns out that time is relative.

Maybe one day I'll understand the concept of time better. Instead of writing further nonsense, I recommend an interesting book that might help you understand the nature of time better, is the book of Carlo Rovelli, you can search for the english edition, I bet that you can enjoy it.
